#### 1.2 Elements of Programming 编程的元素

1. primitive expressions and statements, which represent the simplest building blocks that the language provides,
2. means of combination, by which compound elements are built from simpler ones, and
3. means of abstraction, by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units.


##### 1.2.4   Names and the Environment

A critical aspect of a programming language is the means it provides for using names to refer to computational objects. If a value has been given a name, we say that the name binds to the value.

In Python, we can establish new bindings using the assignment statement, which contains a name to the left of = and a value to the right:

##### 1.2.5   Evaluating Nested Expressions

To evaluate a call expression, Python will do the following:

1. Evaluate the operator and operand subexpressions, then
2. Apply the function that is the value of the operator subexpression to the arguments that are the values of the operand subexpressions.
